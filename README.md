### What it does?
It basically emulates the 6502 assembly with other cool features that I will probably implement.

### Motivation:
Well, there are a lot of emulators out there, and they are more functional than the mine.
But I like electricity, I like CPU and manipulating bits and bytes, that's something that fascinates me, but unfortunately I have not
physical boards, and I'm not in the position to have one, so I decided to create virtual cpu to learn more about it.
Another reason is to learn Rust, Let's see it would be a nice adventure.

### TODO:
- Memory handling.
- Sound.
- More TODOs
